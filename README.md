# ZMK ESB Split Transport

This is a [ZMK](https://zmk.dev) *Split Transport* module adding support for [Enhanced ShockBurst (ESB)](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/protocols/esb/index.html) protocol on Nordic nRF5 Series device.

This work is based on [zmk,wired-split](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/tree/main/app/src/split/wired), [nRF Connect SDK > ESB Examples](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-2.6.4/page/nrf/samples/esb.html) and [ncs-esb-ble-mpsl-demo](https://github.com/too1/ncs-esb-ble-mpsl-demo/).


## What it does

This module uses [nRF Connect SDK (NCS)](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/index.html) ESB implementation as communication protocol between ZMK central and peripherals, instead of Zephyr BLE stack. The protocol implementation is supporting two-way data packet communication, packet buffering, packet acknowledgment, and automatic retransmission, etc. All devices could be communicated with predefined semantic address. 

This module also uses [Multi-Protocol Service Layer (MPSL)](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/protocols/multiprotocol/index.html) library which provides services for multiprotocol applications that allows the nRF5 radio driver to negotiate for transmission timeslots. 

> UPDATE FOR ZMK 0.4: I'm too stupid to make BLE security libraries in NCS 3.1 be compiled on Zephye 4.1.

~~As result, ZMK central allows to pair BLE host as conventional HID input device (keyboard & mouse) and act as an ESB transceiver simultaneously.~~

And all ZMK peripherals talk to ZMK central over ESB only with reduced packet overhead.

~~However, the MCU embedded radio controller in nRF52840 (which i used to develop on) doesn't have enough resource to establish ESB connection and perform BLE advertising & scanning between central and peripheral at the same time.~~

~~In short, central doesn't have timeslots to scan peripherals, and peripheral doesn't have timeslots to advertising itself to central. But, central has configed as ESB Primarily Receiver (PRX) and it has free timeslots to advertise itself to HID host.~~

### TL;DR;
This module has ~~two~~one topologies.
- USB-only Dongle with ONLY ESB is enabling.
   - Dongle connects to HID host via USB.
   - Peripherals connects to Dongle via ESB with same ESB arbitrary address.
   - Min latency is 1ms.
   - Power consumption on TX is a bit less than BLE in long term, it does not keep connected to RX.
   - Sample *zmk-config* for a [Corne 36 keys](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) with couple [pointabella](https://github.com/badjeff/pointabella) variants and [moudabella](https://github.com/badjeff/moudabella) could be find at [here](https://github.com/badjeff/zmk-config/tree/esb-shield-only/boards/shields/donki36).
- ~~Wireless Split Central or Dongle, with BOTH BLE and ESB is enabling.~~
   - ~~Split Central pairs to HID host via BLE.~~
   - ~~Split Peripherals connects to Split Central via ESB.~~
   - ~~Min latency is 7.5ms + 1ms.~~
   - ~~Power consumption is about 7.5mA @ 4.0v on central, v.s. 0.65mA with only BLE enabling.~~
   - ~~Split Central is limited be pairing to **single** BLE host on nRF52840.
     *(NOTE: There is not enough radio resource to perform BLE advertising once it is connected to a paired host. Not tested on nRF53/54)*~~

> [!NOTE]
> Since ZMK 0.4 uses Zephyr 4.1, a patched version of NCS with couple default values is needed to pass CMake config validation. You could see what were patched in my NCS fork from [here](https://github.com/badjeff/sdk-nrf/commits/v3.1-branch%2Bzmk-fixes/).

And, add ESB arbitrary address to `{shield}.overlay` of your central and peripherals.
```c
/{
    esb_split {
        compatible = "zmk,esb-split";
        // These are arbitrary default addresses. In end user products
        // different addresses should be used for each set of devices.
        base-addr-0 = <0xE7 0xE7 0xE7 0xE7>;
        base-addr-1 = <0xC2 0xC2 0xC2 0xC2>;
        addr-prefix = <0xE7 0xC2 0xC3 0xC4 0xC5 0xC6 0xC7 0xC8>;
    };
};
```
